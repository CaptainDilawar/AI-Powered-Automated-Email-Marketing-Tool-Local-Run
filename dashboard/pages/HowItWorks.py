    - **Register**: First, create an account from the **Register** page.
    - **Login**: Once registered, log in from the **Login** page.
    - **Configure Sender Settings**: Navigate to the **Sender Settings** page from the sidebar. Here, you must enter:
        - Your sender name, company, and contact details.
        - These details will be used in the emails you send.
        - **Important for Reply Analysis**: You will also need to provide your IMAP Email, IMAP Server (e.g., `imap.gmail.com`), and an **App Password** for your email account.
            - **For Gmail/Google Accounts**: If you use 2-Step Verification, you'll need to generate an App Password. Go to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) to create one. Select 'Mail' for the app and 'Other (Custom name)' for the device, then generate the password. Use this generated password in the 'IMAP App Password' field.
            - **For Outlook/Microsoft Accounts**: You might also need to generate an App Password if you have 2-Step Verification enabled. Check your Microsoft account security settings for 'App passwords'.
            - **For Other Providers**: Consult your email provider's documentation for generating app-specific passwords or enabling IMAP access.
